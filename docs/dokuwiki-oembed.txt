----

The oEmbed plugin allows you to easily embed media from any provider that supports the [[https://oembed.com/|oEmbed]] format.

===== Install =====

Search for and install the plugin using the [[plugin:extension|Extension Manager]]. Refer to :Plugins on how to install plugins manually.

===== Syntax =====

The simplest way to embed media is with its url. e.g. ''%%{{>http://example.com/}}%%''

Some providers can be given extra options in the form ''%%{{>url?options}}%%'' such as ''%%maxwidth%%'' or ''%%maxheight%%''

An oembed provider will specify a URL scheme and API endpoint pairs. If you know the endpoint you can also use the ''%%!direct%%'' keyword to send paramaters to the API endpoint

===== Examples =====

Embed a single image from Flickr

''%%{{>http://www.flickr.com/photos/foam/41018347952}}~%%''

embed an image with a maximum width of 800px

''%%{{>http://www.flickr.com/photos/foam/41018347952?maxwidth=800}}~%%''

embed a gallery

''%%{{>http://www.flickr.com/photos/flickr/galleries/72157667259442778/}}~%%''

use the API endpoint directly

''%%{{>http://www.flickr.com/services/oembed/ !direct ?url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/5018415361/}}%%''

===== Further =====

A list of oembed providers can be found on the [[https://oembed.com/|oEmbed website]] and [[https://noembed.com/|Noembed]] can provide a consitent inferface for supported and unsupoprted site.

===== Known issues =====

The current plugin (as of 2019) has been updated from an old unmaintained version but doesn't use the new plugin skeleton and may not be fully compatible with current/future versions of dokuwiki.

  * can't resolve https urls for some providers
