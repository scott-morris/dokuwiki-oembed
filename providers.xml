<!--
    Provider List
        for DokuWiki OEmbed plugin

    Important:
        Due to the risk of a cross-site scripting attack
        [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting] only list providers
        that you trust. Remove any providers that you do not trust.
    
    Usage:
        Each provider element has two attributes: name, which is currently not
        used and api which is the API endpoint for the provider's OEmbed
        service. Each provider also lists scheme elements which contain the
        regular expressions of the URLs for which the API endpoint can be used.
        The regular expressions are matched agains the entire URL (no need for
        '^$') and case insensitively. The schemes listed on oembed.com are not
        valid regular expressions and need to be converted.
        
        Providers listed under PROXY PROVIDERS are not content providers but
        instead act as intermediaries for providers that may or may not natively
        support OEmbed.
